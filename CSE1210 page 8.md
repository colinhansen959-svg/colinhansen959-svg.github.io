# 15. List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.

I like playing and making video games, as well as playing sports, so I tried to 
combine the two, so I make and play sports video games. I started learning coding 
about a year ago, and my first language was C#. I used mostly Youtube videos, as well 
as a book called head first C#, which were both really helpful. I also took a short 
python course at my school prior, but it wasn’t very good and they didn’t offer 
anymore computer electives after that. Most of my games don’t end up working, but the 
ones that do are fun and really awesome, and that’s why I decided to take this course. 
To become a better programmer.

# 16. How might CSE1210 connect to my future occupational choices.

CSE1210 has shown me the basics of website making, which could give me foundation for 
getting a job in website design and programming in the future.
