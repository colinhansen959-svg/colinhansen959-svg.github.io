# 13. Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages

A markup language is a system that describes the formatting, structure and meaning of 
data and text within a document, but doesn’t do any programming logic. 

A scripting language is a language that automates things, does programming logic and 
give instructions for software and computer systems to interpret and run. Scripting 
language code is interpreted by the computer line by line, rather than all at once.

# 14. What is the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD)?

SGML is a meta-language that is used to create other markup languages. Both XML and 
HTML-other markup languages-are based off of SGML. XHTML is based off of HTML, but 
with the stricter syntax of XML. DHTML isn’t just on language. It is a combination of 
HTML, CSS and Javascript. Markdown is a an easy to read scripting language. All of 
these are markup languages which are used for designing web pages and formatting data.
