# Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.



# 4. What is the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, and how does this protocol provide the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships?

The TCP/IP is a framework that defines a set of rules for data transfer over the 
internet. How it works is it breaks down data into packets, and then transferred over 
the internet by the IP, and the TCP makes sure that it is delivered and reassembled at 
the right location. It allows for HTTP messages to be sent and received, which enables 
client server communication.
