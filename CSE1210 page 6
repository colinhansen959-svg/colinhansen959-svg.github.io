# 11. Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.

Web 1.0 was more about providing information, and had little interactivity on 
websites, and was not very user friendly. Web 2.0 was more interactive and user 
friendly, so that anyone could use it. Web 3.0 is rumored to be the third evolution of 
the world wide web, and is still being worked on, but it is supposed to be 
decentralized, and easier to use, because of AI using the meaning of the words, not 
just searching for keywords.
