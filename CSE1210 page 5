# 9. What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?

HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the foundation for the world wide web. 
It is the way web browsers and web servers communicate. The web server gets a HTTP 
request from a web browser, and the server sends the data that was asked for. The 
difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTP sends just straight text, and HTTPS 
sends encrypted text for security.

# 10. Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.

Web 1.0 was the static web, which had mostly read only content, static web pages and 
very little interactivity. Web 2.0 was the social web, which had dynamic content and 
user generated data, as well as it was the start of social media and mobile apps. Web 
3.0, the semantic web, is still emerging, and its main features are that it is AI 
driven, uses blockchain decentralization, and uses semantic data for better, more 
accurate, and smarter searching and automation.
